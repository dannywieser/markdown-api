## ✨ Unlock the full power of your Bear notes.

[Bear](https://bear.app) is a joy to write in—simple, beautiful, and built around Markdown.

But because your notes live inside a database, it’s hard to take them anywhere beyond what Bear itself provides.

This app adds an API for interacting with your notes, opening up endless possibilities for new ways to retrieve, query and interact with your notes in Bear.

> This project is in progress, official release coming soon.
